A systematic review and meta-analysis of cancer patients affected by a novel coronavirus,cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients with COVID-19 disease have been reported to have double the case fatality rate of the general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv was done for studies on cancer patients with COVID-19. Pooled proportions were calculated for categorical variables. Odds ratio and forest plots were constructed for both primary and secondary outcomes. The random-effects model was used to account for heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: This systematic review of 31 studies and meta-analysis of 181,323 patients from 26 studies involving 23,736 cancer patients is the largest meta-analysis to the best of our knowledge assessing outcomes in cancer patients affected by COVID-19. Our meta-analysis shows that cancer patients with COVID-19 have a higher likelihood of death (odds ratio, OR 2.54), which was largely driven by mortality among patients in China. Cancer patients were more likely to be intubated, although ICU admission rates were not statistically significant. Among cancer subtypes, the mortality was highest in hematological malignancies (OR 2.43) followed by lung cancer (OR 1.8). There was no association between receipt of a particular type of oncologic therapy and mortality. Our study showed that cancer patients affected by COVID-19 are a decade older than the normal population and have a higher proportion of co-morbidities. There was insufficient data to assess the association of COVID-directed therapy and survival outcomes in cancer patients. Despite the heterogeneity of studies and inconsistencies in reported variables and outcomes, these data could guide clinical practice and oncologic care during this unprecedented global health pandemic. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients with COVID-19 disease are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity. A more nuanced understanding of the interaction between cancer-directed therapies and COVID-19-directed therapies is needed. This will require uniform prospective recording of data, possibly in multi-institutional registry databases.",4gjzbroq
An inverse stage-shift model to estimate the excess mortality and health economic impact of delayed access to cancer services due to the COVID-19 pandemic,cancer,"Background: Decreased cancer incidence and reported changes to clinical management indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in diagnostic and treatment delays for cancer patients. We aimed to develop a flexible model to estimate the impact of delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation on survival outcomes and healthcare costs based on a shift in the disease stage at treatment initiation. Methods: The stage-shift model estimates population-level health economic outcomes by weighting disease stage-specific outcomes by the distribution of stages at treatment initiation, assuming delays lead to stage-progression. It allows for extrapolation of population-level survival data using parametric distributions to calculate the expected survival in life years. The model was demonstrated based on an analysis of the impact of 3 and 6-month delays for stage I breast cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer patients, and for T1 melanoma, based on Australian data. In the absence of patient-level data about time to stage progression, two approaches were explored to estimate the proportion of patients that would experience a stage shift following the delay: 1) based on the relation between time to treatment initiation and overall survival (breast, colorectal and lung cancer), and 2) based on the tumour growth rate (melanoma). The model is available on http://stage-shift.personex.nl/. Results: A shift from stage I to stage II due to a 6-month delay is least likely for colorectal cancer patients, with an estimated proportion of 3% of the stage I patients diagnosed in 2020 progressing to stage II, resulting in 11 excess deaths after 5 years and a total of 96 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon. For breast and lung cancer, progression from stage I to stage II due to a 6-month delay were slightly higher at 5% (breast cancer) and 8% (lung cancer), resulting in 25 and 43 excess deaths after 5 years, and 239 and 373 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon, respectively. For melanoma, with 32% of T1 patients progressing to T2 disease following a 6-month delay, the model estimated 270 excess death after 5 years and 2584 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon. Conclusions: Using a conservative 3-month delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study predicts nearly 90 excess deaths and $12 million excess healthcare costs in Australia over 5 years for the in 2020 diagnosed patients for 4 cancers. If the delays increase to 6 months, excess mortality and cost approach nearly 350 deaths and $46 million in Australia. More accurate data on stage of disease during and after the COVID-19 pandemic are critical to obtain more reliable estimates.",563ci03k
Association of Cancer with Risk and Mortality of COVID-19: Results from the UK Biobank,cancer,"Although cancer has been associated with COVID-19 risk and mortality in hospital-based studies, few population-based studies have been reported. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank (UKB), a population-based prospective cohort, we formally tested the association of over 44 different types of cancer with COVID-19 infection and mortality among 7,661 subjects who were tested by June 17, 2020. Compared to non-cancer subjects, cancer subjects (N=1,521) had significantly lower overall risk for COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 (0.68-0.92), P=2.60E-03]. However, a trend of higher risk for COVID-19 mortality was found among 256 COVID-19 positive cancer patients, especially for hematologic cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3.82 (1.17-12.01), P=0.02]. In cancer patients, while few demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity factors predicted risk for COVID-19 infection, older age, male sex, heart disease and hypertension significantly predicted COVID-19 mortality. The lower risk for COVID-19 infection is likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and more testing among cancer patients, an encouraging finding that demonstrates the feasibility of intervention. These results, if confirmed in future releases of UKB data and other independent populations, may provide guidance for COVID-19 prevention and treatment among cancer patients.",c2v0dsxs
Cancer and risk of COVID-19 through a general community survey,cancer,"Background: Data are limited on the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among individuals with cancer and whether cancer-related therapy exacerbates this risk. Methods: We evaluated the risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients living with cancer compared to the general community and whether cancer-related treatments influence this risk. Data were collected from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application since March 24, 2020 (United Kingdom), March 29 (U.S.), and April 29, 2020 (Sweden) through May 8, 2020. We used multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of a positive COVID-19 test as well as predicted COVID-19 infection using a validated symptom model. Results: Among 23,266 participants with cancer and 1,784,293 without cancer, we documented 10,404 reports of a positive COVID-19 test. Compared to participants without cancer, those living with cancer had 62% increased risk of a positive COVID-19 test (95% CI: 1.37-1.91). Among patients with cancer, current treatment with chemotherapy/immunotherapy was associated with a nearly 2.5-fold increased risk of a positive test (aOR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.81-3.25). The association between cancer and COVID-19+ was stronger among participants >65 years (aOR: 1.93; 95%CI: 1.51-2.46) compared to younger participants (aOR: 1.32; 95%CI: 1.06-1.64; Pinteraction<0.001); and among males (aOR: 1.71; 95%CI: 1.36-2.15) compared to females (aOR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.14-1.79; Pinteraction=0.02). Conclusions: Individuals with cancer had a significantly increased risk of infection compared to the general community. Those treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy were particularly at-risk of infection. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04331509",2ig961lu
"Cancer diagnostic rates during the 2020 'lockdown', due to COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the 2018-2019: an audit study from cellular pathology.",cancer,AIMS We performed an audit to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic-related delay in the diagnosis of major cancers at a Pathology Unit of a Secondary Care Hospital Network in Italy. METHODS A comparison was made among the number of first cellular pathological diagnoses of malignancy made from the 11th to the 20th week of the years 2018-2020. RESULTS Cancer diagnoses fell in 2020 by 39% compared with the average number recorded in 2018 and 2019. Prostate cancer (75%) bladder cancer (66%) and colorectal cancer (CRC; 62%) had the greatest decrease. CRC was identified as carrying a potentially important diagnostic delay. CONCLUSIONS For CRC corrective procedures (continuing mass screening tests; patient triage by family physicians; diagnostic procedures alternative to colonoscopy; predictive evaluation on biopsy samples) were advised. Our simple audit model is widely applicable to avoid pandemic-related delay in clinical diagnosis of cancer.,vca4gwo0
"Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity in patients with cancer in Wuhan, China: a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study",cancer,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread globally. Epidemiological susceptibility to COVID-19 has been reported in patients with cancer. We aimed to systematically characterise clinical features and determine risk factors of COVID-19 disease severity for patients with cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort study, we included all adult patients (aged ??8 years) with any type of malignant solid tumours and haematological malignancy who were admitted to nine hospitals in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020. Enrolled patients were statistically matched (2:1) with patients admitted with COVID-19 who did not have cancer with propensity score on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Demographic characteristics, laboratory examinations, illness severity, and clinical interventions were compared between patients with COVID-19 with or without cancer as well as between patients with cancer with non-severe or severe COVID-19. COVID-19 disease severity was defined on admission on the basis of the WHO guidelines. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, cancer type, tumour stage, and antitumour treatments, were used to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR2000030807. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020, 13 077 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the nine hospitals in Wuhan and 232 patients with cancer and 519 statistically matched patients without cancer were enrolled. Median follow-up was 29 days (IQR 22??8) in patients with cancer and 27 days (20??5) in patients without cancer. Patients with cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 than patients without cancer (148 [64%] of 232 vs 166 [32%] of 519; odds ratio [OR] 3?61 [95% CI 2?59???04]; p<0?0001). Risk factors previously reported in patients without cancer, such as older age; elevated interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and D-dimer; and reduced lymphocytes were validated in patients with cancer. We also identified advanced tumour stage (OR 2?60, 95% CI 1?05???43; p=0?039), elevated tumour necrosis factor ? (1?22, 1?01???47; p=0?037), elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (1?65, 1?03???78; p=0?032), reduced CD4+ T cells (0?84, 0?71???98; p=0?031), and reduced albumin??lobulin ratio (0?12, 0?02???77; p=0?024) as risk factors of COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer. INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer and COVID-19 were more likely to deteriorate into severe illness than those without cancer. The risk factors identified here could be helpful for early clinical surveillance of disease progression in patients with cancer who present with COVID-19.

Effect of Cancer on Clinical Outcomes of Patients With COVID-19: A Meta-Analysis of Patient Data,cancer,"PURPOSE: Whether cancer is associated with worse prognosis among patients with COVID-19 is unknown. We aimed to quantify the effect (if any) of the presence as opposed to absence of cancer on important clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, medRxiv, COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), and references of relevant articles up to April 27, 2020, to identify observational studies comparing patients with versus without cancer infected with COVID-19 and to report on mortality and/or need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs with a random-effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020181531). RESULTS: A total of 32 studies involving 46,499 patients (1,776 patients with cancer) with COVID-19 from Asia, Europe, and the United States were included. All-cause mortality was higher in patients with versus those without cancer (2,034 deaths; RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.07; P < .0001; 8 studies with 37,807 patients). The need for ICU admission was also more likely in patients with versus without cancer (3,220 events; RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.87; P < .0001; 26 studies with 15,375 patients). However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients > 65 years of age, all-cause mortality was comparable between those with versus without cancer (915 deaths; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.41; P = .71; 8 studies with 5,438 patients). CONCLUSION: The synthesized evidence suggests that cancer is associated with worse clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19. However, elderly patients with cancer may not be at increased risk of death when infected with COVID-19. These findings may inform discussions of clinicians with patients about prognosis and may guide health policies.",ezrrcsf3
Haematological Cancers and the risk of severe COVID??9: Exploration and critical evaluation of the evidence to date,cancer,"From the outset of the COVID??9 pandemic, patients and health care professionals have been concerned that a history of haematological malignancy will lead to an increased risk of severe COVID??9. This led to the UK government advising patients with blood cancers to shield, massive re??rganisation of NHS haematology and cancer services, and changes in treatment plans for thousands of patients. Given the unknown effects that relaxation of social distancing measures will have on the infection rate, we review the evidence to date to see whether a history of haematological malignancy is associated with increased risk of COVID??9. Multivariable analysis of large population studies, taking other known risk factors into account do indicate that patients with haematological malignancy, especially those diagnosed recently are at increased risk of death with COVID??9 compared to the general population. The evidence that this risk is higher than for those with solid malignancies is conflicting. There is suggestive evidence from smaller cohort studies that those with myeloid malignancy may be at increased risk within the blood cancer population, but this needs to be confirmed on larger studies. Ongoing large collaborative efforts are required to gain further evidence regarding specific risk factors for severe complications of COVID??9.",mkabcvkw
Impact of COVID -19 in cancer patients on severity of disease and fatal outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,cancer,"BACKGROUND AND AIMSBACKGROUND Currently there is limited knowledge on cancer and COVID-19; we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of cancer on serious events including ICU admission rate and mortality in COVID 19. METHODS PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials were searched on April 16, 2020, to extract published articles that reported the outcomes of cancer in COVID-19 patients. The search terms were ""coronavirus"" and ""clinical characteristics"" with no language or time restrictions. We identified 512 published results and 13 studies were included in the analysis. RESULTS There were 3775 patients, of whom 63 (1?66%) had a cancer. The pooled estimates of ICU admission in COVID 19 patients with and without cancer were 40% versus 8?42%.The odds ratio of ICU admission rates between the cancer and non-cancer groups was 2.88 with a 95% CI of 1?18 to 7?01 (p = 0?026). The pooled estimates of death rate in COVID -19 patients with and without cancer were 20?83% versus 7?82%. The odds ratio of death rates between the cancer and non-cancer groups was 2.25 with a 95% CI ranging from 0?71 to 7?10 with p value of 0?166. The pooled prevalence of cancer patients was 2% (95 CI 1-4). CONCLUSIONS Presence of cancer in COVID-19 leads to higher risk of developing serious events i.e. ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and mortality. The presence of cancer has a significant impact on mortality rate in COVID-19 patients.",7euep0gc
Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Management of Patients with Cancer,cancer,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak is having a profound impact on the management of patients with cancer. In this review, we comprehensively investigate the various aspects of cancer care during the pandemic, taking advantage of data generated in Asia and Europe at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic spread. Cancer wards have been subjected to several modifications to protect patients and healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infection, while attempting to maintain cancer diagnosis, therapy, and research. In this setting, the management of COVID-19 infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging. We also discuss the direct and potential remote impacts of the global pandemic on the mortality of patients with cancer. As such, the indirect impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the potential consequences in terms of cancer mortality are discussed. As the infection is spreading worldwide, we are obtaining more knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic consequences that are currently impacting and may continue to further challenge cancer care in several countries.",6aq29ajy
"Kawasaki disease, autoimmune disorders, and cancer: a register-based study",cancer,"Kawasaki disease has well-described cardiovascular complications. However, the association to autoimmunity and cancer in the long term is not well described. We investigated theses associations using a registry-based matched cohort follow-up study of patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease. Patients with Kawasaki disease were included and matched 1:5 to a population control group, matched by birth year, sex and incident month of the Kawasaki disease diagnosis. A total of 820 cases < 21 years of age were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 3 years. Median follow-up time was 12 years. Patients with KD were at higher risk of being diagnosed with ischaemic heart disease at 10 years (HR 39.94 (95% CI 5.00??19.28)) and 30 years (HR 8.33 (95% CI 3.03??2.91)). The 10-, 20- and 30-year risks of developing autoimmune disorders were HR 4.23 (95% CI 3.01??.94), HR 3.23 (95% CI 2.44??.29) and 2.83 (95% CI, 2.17??.68), all p < 0.001. Cancer risk was increased after 30 years (HR 2.42 (95% CI, 1.09??.34)). All-cause mortality after 35 years was also significantly increased (HR 3.14 (95% CI, 1.03??.60)). Children with KD have increased long-term risks of ischaemic heart disease also of autoimmune disease and cancer, as well as an increased all-cause mortality. The surprisingly increased risk of autoimmunity must be investigated further.",dcx1lpfk
"Persistent digital divide in health-related internet use among cancer survivors: findings from the Health Information National Trends Survey, 2003??018",cancer,"PURPOSE: Prior research on the use of the internet among cancer survivors indicates a digital divide. The online landscape and patterns of information consumption, however, have notably changed over the past decade necessitating an updated examination of health-related internet use (HRIU) among cancer survivors. METHODS: Using survey data from 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) iterations, the objectives of this study were to report prevalence, trends, and user profiles in HRIU in terms of emailing doctors, buying medicine online, and support group participation. Descriptive analyses and weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Cancer survivors who reported not using the internet were more likely to be older, belong to ethnic minorities, be less educated, and reside in rural areas as compared with those who reported using the internet. Except for participation in online support groups, all other types of HRIU increased in prevalence across the years. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the increased penetration of the internet and the altered online health communication landscape, we found increased prevalence of HRIU among cancer survivors. However, the digital divide persists in terms of internet access. These findings can inform initiatives to bridge the gap among survivors of varying profiles in using the internet for their health needs. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: There is increased reliance on online platforms to obtain and communicate health-related information. The risk with this approach is potential oversight of ensuring equity in terms of internet access and technology literacy among survivors.

The risk and prognosis of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,cancer,"Numerous studies have been published regarding outcomes of cancer patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. However, most of these are single-center studies with a limited number of patients. To better assess the outcomes of this new infection in this subgroup of susceptible patients, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 infection on cancer patients. We performed a literature search using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies that reported the risk of infection and complications of COVID-19 in cancer patients and retrieved 22 studies (1018 cancer patients). The analysis showed that the frequency of cancer among patients with confirmed COVID-19 was 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-3) in the overall cohort. These patients had a mortality of 21.1% (95% CI: 14.7-27.6), severe/critical disease rate of 45.4% (95% CI: 37.4-53.3), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate of 14.5% (95% CI: 8.5-20.4), and mechanical ventilation rate of 11.7% (95% CI: 5.5-18). The double-arm analysis showed that cancer patients had a higher risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR]???=???3.23, 95% CI: 1.71-6.13), severe/critical disease (OR???=???3.91, 95% CI: 2.70-5.67), ICU admission (OR???=???3.10, 95% CI: 1.85-5.17), and mechanical ventilation (OR???=???4.86, 95% CI: 1.27-18.65) than non-cancer patients. Furthermore, cancer patients had significantly lower platelet levels and higher D-dimer levels, C-reactive protein levels, and prothrombin time. In conclusion, these results indicate that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection-related complications. Therefore, cancer patients need diligent preventive care measures and aggressive surveillance for earlier detection of COVID-19 infection.",viszk7hd
Which type of cancer patients are more susceptible to the SARS-COX-2: evidence from a meta-analysis and bioinformatics analysis,cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have reported that patients with cancer seem to be more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is still unknown the prevalence of different types of cancer in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, this study will explore which type of cancer patients are more susceptible to the SARS-COX-2. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified by searching several electronic databases for relevant studies published before April 28, 2020. The language was restricted to English or Chinese. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata 12.0. The GEPIA database evaluated the expression of SARS-COX-2 infection key genes in different types of normal and tumor samples. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies, including 205 patients, were identified to be eligible for this meta-analysis. Among the cancer patients infected by SARS-COX-2, the proportion of patients with the lung, colorectal,breast,esophagus,bladder,pancreatic and cervical cancer were 24.7%, 20.5%, 13.0%, 7.6%,7.3%,6.1%,and 6.0%, respectively. These findings were also corroborated by the results of the GEPIA database. CONCLUSION: Compared with other types of cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer are more susceptible to SARS-COX-2 infection.",moh0f5gl
"A prospective cohort study that examined acute kidney injury and kidney outcomes, cardiovascular events and death informs on long-term clinical outcomes.",kidney,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported to be associated with excess risks of death, kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events although previous studies have important limitations. To further examine this, we prospectively studied adults from four clinical centers surviving three months and more after hospitalization with or without AKI who were matched on center, pre-admission CKD status, and an integrated priority score based on age, prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, preadmission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and treatment in the intensive care unit during the index hospitalization between December 2009-February 2015, with follow-up through November 2018. All participants had assessments of kidney function before (eGFR) and at three months and annually (eGFR and proteinuria) after the index hospitalization. Associations of AKI with outcomes were examined after accounting for pre-admission and three-month post-discharge factors. Among 769 AKI (73% Stage 1, 14% Stage 2, 13% Stage 3) and 769 matched non-AKI adults, AKI was associated with higher adjusted rates of incident CKD (adjusted hazard ratio 3.98, 95% confidence interval 2.51-6.31), CKD progression (2.37,1.28-4.39), heart failure events (1.68, 1.22-2.31) and all-cause death (1.78, 1.24-2.56). AKI was not associated with major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in multivariable analysis (0.95, 0.70-1.28). After accounting for degree of kidney function recovery and proteinuria at three months after discharge, the associations of AKI with heart failure (1.13, 0.80-1.61) and death (1.29, 0.84-1.98) were attenuated and no longer significant. Thus, assessing kidney function recovery and proteinuria status three months after AKI provides important prognostic information for long-term clinical outcomes.",v6n4lzjh
Acute Kidney Injury in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19,kidney,"Importance: Preliminary reports indicate that acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 patients and is associated with worse outcomes. AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States is not well-described. Objective: To provide information about frequency, outcomes and recovery associated with AKI and dialysis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design: Observational, retrospective study. Setting: Admitted to hospital between February 27 and April 15, 2020. Participants: Patients aged [??18 years with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 Exposures: AKI (peak serum creatinine increase of 0.3 mg/dL or 50% above baseline). Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with mortality. We also trained and tested a machine learning model for predicting dialysis requirement with independent validation. Results: A total of 3,235 hospitalized patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. AKI occurred in 1406 (46%) patients overall and 280 (20%) with AKI required renal replacement therapy. The incidence of AKI (admission plus new cases) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit was 68% (553 of 815). In the entire cohort, the proportion with stages 1, 2, and 3 AKI were 35%, 20%, 45%, respectively. In those needing intensive care, the respective proportions were 20%, 17%, 63%, and 34% received acute renal replacement therapy. Independent predictors of severe AKI were chronic kidney disease, systolic blood pressure, and potassium at baseline. In-hospital mortality in patients with AKI was 41% overall and 52% in intensive care. The aOR for mortality associated with AKI was 9.6 (95% CI 7.4-12.3) overall and 20.9 (95% CI 11.7-37.3) in patients receiving intensive care. 56% of patients with AKI who were discharged alive recovered kidney function back to baseline. The area under the curve (AUC) for the machine learned predictive model using baseline features for dialysis requirement was 0.79 in a validation test. Conclusions and Relevance: AKI is common in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, associated with worse mortality, and the majority of patients that survive do not recover kidney function.

COVID-19 and the kidney: what we think we know so far and what we don??,kidney,"The novel coronavirus disease infection (COVID-19) outbreak that was declared a global pandemic in March 2020 had led to an internationally variable but concerning incidence of COVID-associated acute kidney injury (AKI), with prevalence reported as high as 46% in large cohorts of hospitalized patients. Variability in AKI may be explained by differences in traditional risk factors for AKI, heterogeneity among patient cohorts, and differences in racial and ethnic groups. Further, AKI requiring kidney replacement therapies (KRT) has been associated with increased mortality. Proposed mechanisms of kidney injury include direct viral-induced tubular or glomerular injury, sepsis-associated AKI, and thrombotic disease. Kidney pathology include acute tubular injury, glomerular fibrin thrombi, pigmented tubular casts, and collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. ??iral-like??particles have been observed in renal samples at electron microscopy and viral RNA has been identified in both glomerular and tubular compartments of kidney specimens, but the link between viral presence and injury remain unclear. Though the link between AKI and poor outcomes is clear, prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease has not yet been reported. In patients on immunosuppression like those with kidney transplants or glomerular disease, COVID-19 has presented a management dilemma. Herein, we review the existing literature on kidney disease in COVID-19 and discuss what remains to be learned.",q4a9c13e
COVID-19 pandemic: The role of community pharmacists in chronic kidney disease management supportive care,kidney,"The COVID-19 pandemic is putting enormous pressure on healthcare systems worldwide and various countries are struggling to flatten the curve to prevent their healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed. Studies have shown that people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality. However, the interruption of routine care and support due to the current challenges with healthcare providers, facilities, and essential medicines due to this pandemic is adversely affecting people with CKD. This is because poor management of this disease leads to negative health outcomes. In order to maintain good health, this vulnerable group of patients rely heavily on the extended role of the community pharmacists in chronic disease management. This paper highlights the extended role of the community pharmacists in CKD management supportive care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",nb87g2ck
COVID??9 and kidney transplantation: Results from the TANGO International Transplant Consortium,kidney,"Kidney transplant recipients may be at a high risk of developing critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID??9) illness due to chronic immunosuppression and comorbidities. We identified hospitalized adult kidney transplant recipients at 12 transplant centers in the United States, Italy, and Spain who tested positive for COVID??9. Clinical presentation, laboratory values, immunosuppression, and treatment strategies were reviewed, and predictors of poor clinical outcomes were determined through multivariable analyses. Among 9845 kidney transplant recipients across centers, 144 were hospitalized due to COVID??9 during the 9??eek study period. Of the 144 patients, 66% were male with a mean age of 60 (?12) years, and 40% were Hispanic and 25% were African American. Prevalent comorbidities included hypertension (95%), diabetes (52%), obesity (49%), and heart (28%) and lung (19%) disease. Therapeutic management included antimetabolite withdrawal (68%), calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal (23%), hydroxychloroquine (71%), antibiotics (74%), tocilizumab (13%), and antivirals (14%). During a median follow??p period of 52 days (IQR: 16??6 days), acute kidney injury occurred in 52% cases, with respiratory failure requiring intubation in 29%, and the mortality rate was 32%. The 46 patients who died were older, had lower lymphocyte counts and estimated glomerular filtration rate levels, and had higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, and interleukin?? levels. In sum, hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with COVID??9 have higher rates of acute kidney injury and mortality.",p2lwocse
COVID??9 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Focus on immunosuppression management,kidney,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease of 2019, also known as COVID??9, has been declared a global pandemic. Significant controversies exist regarding treatment modalities for this novel disease, especially in immunocompromised patients. Experience with management of COVID??9 in kidney transplant recipients is scarce; effects of this virus on immunosuppressed individuals are not well understood. METHODS: We identified 30 renal transplant recipients with confirmed COVID??9 pneumonia who were admitted to inpatient between March 2020 and April 2020. All patients received a 5??ay course of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; half of the patients received methylprednisolone. During hospitalization, calcineurin inhibitors and antimetabolites were held; prednisone was continued. RESULTS: Clinical presentation of flu??ike symptoms was similar to those in the general population. Hyponatremia, lymphopenia, acute kidney injury, and elevated inflammatory markers were common. Over the course of follow??p, 23 have been discharged home with a functioning allograft and in stable condition; 4 experienced acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy; 7 patients were intubated, and 6 expired. The mortality rate in our cohort was 20%. CONCLUSION: Our findings described the characteristics and outcomes of this highly fatal illness in a multi??thnic kidney transplant cohort, with insights on immunosuppression management that could further our understanding of this unique disease in immunocompromised populations.",e92omqyr
Characterization of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019,kidney,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) frequency, severity and characterization in critically ill patients has not been reported. METHODS: Single-centre cohort performed from 3 March 2020 to 14 April 2020 in four intensive care units in Bordeaux University Hospital, France. All patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary severity criteria were included. AKI was defined using Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. A systematic urinary analysis was performed. The incidence, severity, clinical presentation, biological characterization (transient versus persistent AKI; proteinuria, haematuria and glycosuria) and short-term outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were included, with basal serum creatinine (SCr) of 69 ? 21 ?mol/L. At admission, AKI was present in 8/71 (11%) patients. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] follow-up was 17 (12??3) days. AKI developed in a total of 57/71 (80%) patients, with 35% Stage 1, 35% Stage 2 and 30% Stage 3 AKI; 10/57 (18%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Transient AKI was present in only 4/55 (7%) patients and persistent AKI was observed in 51/55 (93%). Patients with persistent AKI developed a median (IQR) urine protein/creatinine of 82 (54??40) (mg/mmol) with an albuminuria/proteinuria ratio of 0.23 ? 20, indicating predominant tubulointerstitial injury. Only two (4%) patients had glycosuria. At Day 7 after onset of AKI, six (11%) patients remained dependent on RRT, nine (16%) had SCr >200 ?mol/L and four (7%) had died. Day 7 and Day 14 renal recovery occurred in 28% and 52%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19-associated AKI is frequent, persistent, severe and characterized by an almost exclusive tubulointerstitial injury without glycosuria.",mrznt2dx
Coronavirus disease 2019 in chronic kidney disease,kidney,"The clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death More severe cases with higher mortality have been reported in older patients and in those with chronic illness such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular diseases In this regard, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a higher rate of all-type infections and cardiovascular disease than the general population A markedly altered immune system and immunosuppressed state may predispose CKD patients to infectious complications Likewise, they have a state of chronic systemic inflammation that may increase their morbidity and mortality In this review we discuss the chronic immunologic changes observed in CKD patients, the risk of COVID-19 infections and the clinical implications for and specific COVID-19 therapy in CKD patients Indeed, the risk for severe COVID-19 is 3-fold higher in CKD than in non-CKD patients;CKD is 12-fold more frequent in intensive care unit than in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and this ratio is higher than for diabetes or cardiovascular disease;and acute COVID-19 mortality is 15-25% for haemodialysis patients even when not developing pneumonia",1wpv7uee
Coronavirus disease 2019: acute Fanconi syndrome precedes acute kidney injury,kidney,"BACKGROUND: Recent data have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can infect renal proximal tubular cells via Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) . Our objective was to determine whether Fanconi syndrome is a frequent clinical feature in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 42 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients without history of kidney disease hospitalized in University Hospital of Nancy was investigated. Patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (n = 28) or the Medical department (n = 14) and were screened at least once for four markers of proximal tubulopathy. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) follow-up was 19.7 (?12.2) days. Of the patients, 75% (30/40) showed at least two proximal tubule abnormalities (incomplete Fanconi syndrome). The main disorders were proteinuria (88%, n = 35), renal phosphate leak defined by renal phosphate threshold/glomerular filtration rate (TmPi/GFR) <0.77 (55%, n = 22), hyperuricosuria (43%, n = 17) and normoglycaemic glycosuria (30%, n = 12). At the time of the first renal evaluation, ICU patients presented more frequent (96 versus 62%, P = 0.0095) and more severe (844 ? 343 versus 350 ? 221 mg/g, P = 0.0001) proteinuria, and a trend for an increased number of proximal tubule abnormalities (P = 0.038). During follow-up, they presented a lower nadir of serum phosphate [median (interquartile range) 0.68 (0.43??.76) versus 0.77 (0.66??.07) mmol/L, P = 0.044] and Acute kidney Injury (AKI) during the hospitalization (P = 0.045). Fanconi syndrome preceded severe AKI KDIGO Stages 2 and 3 in 88% (7/8) of patients. Proximal tubular abnormalities (such as proteinuria, TmPi/GFR and glycosuria in five, two and two patients, respectively) were not detected anymore in recovering patients before hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: Incomplete Fanconi syndrome is highly frequent in COVID-19 patients and precedes AKI or disappears during the recovery phase.",oinbicza
Fatal Outcomes of COVID-19 in Patients with Severe Acute Kidney Injury,kidney,"The outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with organ damage; however, the information about the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and COVID-19 is still rare. We evaluated the clinical features and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with AKI according to the AKI severity. Medical data of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in two university-based hospitals during an outbreak in Daegu, South Korea, were retrospectively analyzed. AKI and its severity were defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network. Of the 164 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 30 patients (18.3%) had AKI; 14, 4, and 12 patients had stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median age was significantly higher in AKI patients than in non-AKI patients (75.5 vs. 67.0 years, p = 0.005). There were 17 deaths (56.7%) among AKI patients; 4 (28.6%), 1 (25.0%), and 12 (100.0%), respectively. In-hospital mortality was higher in AKI patients than in non-AKI patients (56.7% vs. 20.8%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, stage 3 AKI was associated with higher mortality than either non-AKI or stage 1 AKI (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.75-7.48), p = 0.001; HR = 15.65 (95% CI = 2.43-100.64), p = 0.004). Among the AKI patients, acute respiratory distress syndrome and low serum albumin on admission were considered independent risk factors for stage 3 AKI (both p < 0.05). Five patients with stage 3 AKI underwent dialysis and eventually died. In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with severe AKI had fatal outcomes.",5r8owr1c
Prognosis of COVID-19 in Patients with Liver and Kidney Diseases: An Early Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,kidney,"The mortality and severity in COVID-19 is increased in patients with comorbidities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients with underlying kidney and liver diseases. We retrieved data on the clinical features and primary composite end point of COVID-19 patients from Medline and Embase which had been released from inception by the April 16, 2020. The data on two comorbidities, liver diseases and chronic kidney disease, were pooled and statistically analysed to explain the associated severity and mortality rate. One hundred and forty-Two abstracts were screened, and 41 full articles were then read. In total, 22 studies including 5595 COVID-19 patients were included in this study with case fatality rate of 16%. The prevalence of liver diseases and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were 3% (95% CI; 2-3%) and 1% (95% CI; 1-2%), respectively. In patients with COVID-19 and underlying liver diseases, 57.33% (43/75) of cases were severe, with 17.65% mortality, while in CKD patients, 83.93% (47/56) of cases were severe and 53.33% (8/15) mortality was reported. This study found an increased risk of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients with liver diseases or CKD. This will lead to better clinical management and inform the process of implementing more stringent preventative measures for this group of patients.",itdbrj6k
The Chronic Kidney Disease and Acute Kidney Injury Involvement in COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,kidney,"Aim: The aim of this study was to uncover whether kidney diseases were involved in COVID-19 pandemic from a systematic review. Methods: The studies reported the kidney outcomes in different severity of COVID-19 were included in this study. Standardized mean differences or odds ratios were calculated by employing Review Manager meta-analysis software. Results: Thirty-six trials were included in this systematic review with a total of 6395 COVID-19 patients. The overall effects indicated that the comorbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR = 3.28), complication of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR = 11.02), serum creatinine (SMD = 0.68), abnormal serum creatinine (OR = 4.86), blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.95), abnormal blood urea nitrogen (OR = 6.53), received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (OR = 23.63) was significantly increased in severe group than that in nonsevere group. Additionally, the complication of AKI (OR = 13.92) and blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.18) were remarkably elevated in critical group than that in severe group. Conclusion: CKD and AKI are susceptible to occur in patients with severe COVID-19. CRRT is applied frequently in severe COVID-19 patients than that in nonsevere COVID-19 patients. The risk of AKI is higher in critical group than that in severe group.",dobqll92
A prospective clinical study of detailed neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19,neuro,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a virus pandemic. According to the first obtained data, COVID-19 has defined with findings such as cough, fever, diarrhea, and fatigue although neurological symptoms of patients with COVID-19 have not been investigated in detail. This study aims to investigate the neurological findings via obtained face-to-face anamnesis and detailed neurological examination in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-nine consecutive inpatients with COVID-19, supported with laboratory tests, were evaluated. Detailed neurological examinations and evaluations of all patients were performed. All evaluations and examinations were performed by two neurologists who have at least five-year experience. RESULTS: This study was carried out 239 patients (133 male + 106 female) with diagnosed COVID-19. Neurological findings were present in 83 of 239 patients (34.7%). The most common neurological finding was a headache (27.6%). D-dimer blood levels were detected to be significantly higher in patients with at least one neurological symptom than patients without the neurological symptom (p < 0.05). IL-6 level was found to be significantly higher in patients with headache than without headache (p < 0.05). Creatine kinase (CK) level was detected to be significantly higher in patients with muscle pain (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Neurological symptoms are often seen in patients with COVID-19. Headache was the most common seen neurological symptom in this disease. Dizziness, impaired consciousness, smell and gustation impairments, cerebrovascular disorders, epileptic seizures, and myalgia were detected as other findings apart from the headache. It is suggested that determining these neurological symptoms prevents the diagnosis delay and helps to prohibit virus spread.",rcguim61
Acute Myelitis as a Neurological Complication ofCovid-19:A Case Report and MRI Findings,neuro,"During the recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, there is rising concerns about neurological complications of COVID-19. Fever, headache and anosmia may occur early during the disease course. Other neurological sequalae such as encephalitis may occur in later phases. We report a case of acute myelitis in a 32 year old male Covid-19 positive patient who presented with a two-day history of flu-like symptoms then sudden onset paraplegia and urinary retention. The incidence is not known and the pathogenesis of the disease behind this manifestation is still not fully understood. Nevertheless considering the broad differential diagnosis of acute myelitis, prompt clinical and diagnostic work up was crucial to exclude other causes. Patients presenting with neurological symptoms such as loss of consciousness, ataxia, convulsions, status epilepticus, encephalitis, myelitis or neuritis should raise concerns for Covid-19 infection during this pandemic prompting early diagnosis and initiation of proper management.",ow0t0o6r
Application of Healthcare ??ig Data??in CNS Drug Research: The Example of the Neurological and mental health Global Epidemiology Network (NeuroGEN),neuro,"Neurological and psychiatric (mental health) disorders have a large impact on health burden globally. Cognitive disorders (including dementia) and stroke are leading causes of disability. Mental health disorders, including depression, contribute up to one-third of total years lived with disability. The Neurological and mental health Global Epidemiology Network (NeuroGEN) is an international multi-database network that harnesses administrative and electronic medical records from Australia, Asia, Europe and North America. Using these databases NeuroGEN will investigate medication use and health outcomes in neurological and mental health disorders. A key objective of NeuroGEN is to facilitate high-quality observational studies to address evidence-practice gaps where randomized controlled trials do not provide sufficient information on medication benefits and risks that is specific to vulnerable population groups. International multi-database research facilitates comparisons across geographical areas and jurisdictions, increases statistical power to investigate small subpopulations or rare outcomes, permits early post-approval assessment of safety and effectiveness, and increases generalisability of results. Through bringing together international researchers in pharmacoepidemiology, NeuroGEN has the potential to be paradigm-changing for observational research to inform evidence-based prescribing. The first focus of NeuroGEN will be to address evidence-gaps in the treatment of chronic comorbidities in people with dementia.",uuzv5z0k
Challenges and management of neurological and psychiatric manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) patients,neuro,"COVID-19 is a pandemic caused by human coronavirus (HCoV) SARS-CoV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and spread globally during 2020. Due to the difficulty of clinical decision-making during this period, our study group reviewed current literature focusing on the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. Despite the knowledge on this newly discovered virus which is constantly evolving, different pieces of evidence reported an association between COVID-19 and neurological symptoms like headache, dizziness, taste and smell disorders and complications involving the nervous system eventually triggered by the pathologic processes elicited by SARS-CoV-2. It seems that younger patients are less prone to develop severe forms of COVID-19. However, neurological signs have been reported in paediatric patients as well, and in some cases, the infection presented neurological sequelae. Furthermore, children with particular neurological diseases or treated with specific drugs (e.g. immune-suppressant therapies) must be carefully monitored during this pandemic. Neurologists should be aware of the main drug-drug interactions and the neurological side effects of COVID-19 treatments. Notably, adverse mental health impact has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2, which could be related either to the social strain or to the eventual neurotropic effects of the virus, which in other infections have been proven to promote the onset of psychiatric symptoms. Further, psychiatric population may be more vulnerable to the infection and at higher risk for adverse outcomes.",ibg0cid9
Chronic Neurology in COVID-19 Era: Clinical Considerations and Recommendations From the REPROGRAM Consortium,neuro,"With the rapid pace and scale of the emerging coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a growing body of evidence has shown a strong association of COVID-19 with pre- and post- neurological complications. This has necessitated the need to incorporate targeted neurological care for this subgroup of patients which warrants further reorganization of services, healthcare workforce, and ongoing management of chronic neurological cases. The social distancing and the shutdown imposed by several nations in the midst of COVID-19 have severely impacted the ongoing care, access and support of patients with chronic neurological conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy, Neuromuscular Disorders, Migraine, Dementia, and Parkinson disease. There is a pressing need for governing bodies including national and international professional associations, health ministries and health institutions to harmonize policies, guidelines, and recommendations relating to the management of chronic neurological conditions. These harmonized guidelines should ensure patient continuity across the spectrum of hospital and community care including the well-being, safety, and mental health of the patients, their care partners and the health professionals involved. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on chronic neurological conditions and specific recommendations to minimize the potential harm to those at high risk.",guf50o1x
Clinical characteristics of 106 patients with neurological diseases and co-morbid coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective study,neuro,"Objectives:To describe the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with co-morbid neurological symptoms. Design:Retrospective case series. Setting:Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Participants:From 4 February to 14 April 2020, 106 patients with neurological diseases were enrolled from all patients in the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 and divided into a severe group and a nonsevere group according to their COVID-19 diagnosis. Main outcome measures:Clinical characteristics, laboratory results, imaging findings, and treatment methods were all retrieved through an electronic medical records system and recorded in spreadsheets. Results:The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of patients was 72.7 (11.8) years, and 64 patients were male (60.4%). Among patients with co-morbid neurological diseases, 81 had a previous cerebral infarction (76.4%), 20 had dementia (18.9%), 10 had acute cerebral infarction (9.4%), 5 had sequelae of cerebral haemorrhage (4.7%), 4 had intracranial mass lesions (3.8%), 3 had epilepsy (2.8%), 2 had Parkinsons disease (1.9%), and 1 had myelopathy (0.9%). Fever (n = 62, 58.5%) was the most common symptom. The most common neurological symptoms were myalgia (n = 26, 24.5%), followed by extremity paralysis (n = 20, 18.9%), impaired consciousness (n = 17, 16%), and positive focal neurological signs (n = 42, 39.6%). Eight patients (7.5%) died. There were more patients with altered mental status in the severe group than in the non-severe group (6 [10.2%] vs. 0, P = 0.033). The inflammatory response in the severe group was more significant than that in the non-severe group. There were more patients taking anticoagulant drugs (25 [42.4%] vs. 4 [8.5%], P < 0.001) and sedative drugs (22 [37.3%] vs. 9 [19.1%], P = 0.041) in the severe group than in the non-severe group. Amid all 93 patients with cerebrovascular diseases, only 32 (34.4%) were taking aspirin, 13 (14%) taking clopidogrel, and 33 (35.5%) taking statins. Conclusions:Patients with COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases had an advanced age, a high rate of severe illness, and a high mortality rate. Among the neurological symptoms, altered mental status was more common in patients with severe COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases.",glmshsh6
Consensus for prevention and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for neurologists,neuro,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic disease globally. Although COVID-19 directly invades lungs, it also involves the nervous system. Therefore, patients with nervous system involvement as the presenting symptoms in the early stage of infection may easily be misdiagnosed and their treatment delayed. They become silent contagious sources or 'virus spreaders'. In order to help neurologists to better understand the occurrence, development and prognosis, we have developed this consensus of prevention and management of COVID-19. It can also assist other healthcare providers to be familiar with and recognise COVID-19 in their evaluation of patients in the clinic and hospital environment.",7dgwrn85
Exploring the clinical association between neurological symptoms and COVID-19 pandemic outbreak: a systematic review of current literature,neuro,"OBJECT: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 outbreak has been declared a pandemic in March, 2020. An increasing body of evidence suggests that patients with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might have a heterogeneous spectrum of neurological symptoms METHODS: A systematic search of two databases was performed for studies published up to May 29th, 2020. PRISMA guidelines were followed. RESULTS: We included 19 studies evaluating 12,157 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections. The median age of patients was 50.3 (IQR 11.9), and the rate of male patients was 50.6% (95% CI 49.2-51.6%). The most common reported comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes (31.1%, 95% CI 30-32.3% and 13.5%, 95% CI 12.3-14.8%, respectively). Headache was reported in 7.5% of patients (95% CI 6.6-8.4%), and dizziness in 6.1% (95% CI 5.1-7.1%). Hypo/anosmia, and gustatory dysfunction were reported in 46.8 and 52.3%, of patients, respectively. Symptoms related to muscular injury ranged between 15 and 30%. Three studies reported radiological confirmed acute cerebrovascular disease in 2% of patients (95% CI 1.6-2.4%). CONCLUSIONS: These data support accumulating evidence that a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 infection develop neurological manifestations, especially olfactory, and gustatory dysfunction. The pathophysiology of this association is under investigation and warrants additional studies, Physicians should be aware of this possible association because during the epidemic period of COVID-19, early recognition of neurologic manifestations otherwise not explained would raise the suspect of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.",h1hag2ta
Neurological Comorbidity Is a Predictor of Death in Covid-19 Disease: A Cohort Study on 576 Patients,neuro,"Introduction: Prognosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients with vascular risk factors, and certain comorbidities is worse The impact of chronic neurological disorders (CND) on prognosis is unclear We evaluated if the presence of CND in Covid-19 patients is a predictor of a higher in-hospital mortality As secondary endpoints, we analyzed the association between CND, Covid-19 severity, and laboratory abnormalities during admission Methods: Retrospective cohort study that included all the consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 disease from March 8th to April 11th, 2020 The study setting was Hospital Cl?nico, tertiary academic hospital from Valladolid CND was defined as those neurological conditions causing permanent disability We assessed demography, clinical variables, Covid-19 severity, laboratory parameters and outcome The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality, evaluated by multivariate cox-regression log rank test We analyzed the association between CND, covid-19 severity and laboratory abnormalities Results: We included 576 patients, 43 3% female, aged 67 2 years in mean CND were present in 105 (18 3%) patients Patients with CND were older, more disabled, had more vascular risk factors and comorbidities and fewer clinical symptoms of Covid-19 They presented 1 43 days earlier to the emergency department Need of ventilation support was similar Presence of CND was an independent predictor of death (HR 2 129, 95% CI: 1 382?? 280) but not a severer Covid-19 disease (OR: 1 75, 95% CI: 0 970?? 158) Frequency of laboratory abnormalities was similar, except for procalcitonin and INR Conclusions: The presence of CND is an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized Covid-19 patients That was not explained neither by a worse immune response to Covid-19 nor by differences in the level of care received by patients with CND",5gtayuz9
Neurological Insights of COVID-19 Pandemic,neuro,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was identified after a recent outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has kept the whole world in tenterhooks due to its severe life-threatening nature of the infection. The virus is unlike its previous counterparts, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, or anything the world has encountered before both in terms of virulence and severity of the infection. If scientific reports relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are noted, it can be seen that the virus owes much of its killer properties to its unique structure that has a stronger binding affinity with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) protein, which the viruses utilize as an entry point to gain accesses to its hosts. Recent reports suggest that it is not just the lung that the virus may be targeting; the human brain may soon emerge as the new abode of the virus. Already instances of patients with COVID-19 have been reported with mild (anosmia and ageusia) to severe (encephalopathy) neurological manifestations, and if that is so, then it gives us more reasons to be frightened of this killer virus. Keeping in mind that the situation does not worsen from here, immediate awareness and more thorough research regarding the neuroinvasive nature of the virus is the immediate need of the hour.

Neurological Manifestations in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19: A Retrospective Study,neuro,"Background: The complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involved multiple organs or systems, especially in critically ill patients We aim to investigate the neurological complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 Methods: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed critically ill patients with COVID-19 at the intensive care unit of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China from February 5 to April 2, 2020 Demographic data, clinical and laboratory findings, comorbidities and treatments were collected and analyzed Results: Among 86 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 54 patients (62 8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 66 6 (11 1) years Overall, 65% patients presented with at least one neurological symptom Twenty patients (23 3%) had symptoms involving the central nervous system, including delirium, cerebrovascular diseases and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, while 6 patients (7%) had neuromuscular involvement Seven of 86 patients exhibited new stroke and 6 (7%) cases were ischemic A significantly higher prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies was observed in patients with ischemic stroke than in those without stroke (83 3 vs 26 9%, p &lt; 0 05) Patients with ischemic stroke were more likely to have a higher myoglobulin level, and a lower hemoglobin level Conclusions: The clinical spectrum of neurological complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was broad Stroke, delirium and neuromuscular diseases are common neurological complications of COVID-19 Physicians should pay close attention to neurological complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19",27fb8ug2
"Neurological Manifestations of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective case series study",neuro,"OBJECTIVE: To study the neurological manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN: Retrospective case series SETTING: Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists. RESULTS: Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 ? 15.0 years vs 48.9 ? 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]). CONCLUSION: Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients commonly had neurologic symptoms manifested as acute cerebrovascular diseases, consciousness impairment and skeletal muscle symptoms.",niw61l9r
Neurological and Musculoskeletal Features of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,neuro,"Importance: Some of the symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and breathing difficulty However, the mechanism of the disease, including some of the symptoms such as the neurological and musculoskeletal symptoms, is still poorly understood Objective: The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence on the neurological and musculoskeletal symptoms of the disease This may help with early diagnosis, prevention of disease spread, and treatment planning Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (first 100 hits) were searched until April 17, 2020 The key search terms used were ""coronavirus"" and ""signs and symptoms "" Only studies written in English were included Study Selection: The selection was performed by two independent reviewers using EndNote and Rayyan software Any disagreement was resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer Data Extraction and Synthesis: PRISMA guidelines were followed for abstracting data and assessing the quality of the studies These were carried out by two and three independent reviewers, respectively Any disagreement was resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer The data were analyzed using qualitative synthesis and pooled using a random-effect model Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The outcomes in the study include country, study design, participant details (sex, age, sample size), and neurological and musculoskeletal features Result: Sixty studies (n = 11, 069) were included in the review, and 51 studies were used in the meta-analysis The median or mean age ranged from 24 to 95 years The prevalence of neurological and musculoskeletal manifestations was 35% for smell impairment (95% CI 0-94%;I (2) 99 63%), 33% for taste impairment (95% CI 0-91%;I (2) 99 58%), 19% for myalgia (95% CI 16-23;I (2) 95%), 12% for headache (95% CI 9-15;I (2) 93 12%), 10% for back pain (95% CI 1-23%;I (2) 80 20%), 10% for dizziness (95% CI 3-19%;I (2) 86 74%), 3% for acute cerebrovascular disease (95% CI 1-5%;I (2) 0%), and 2% for impaired consciousness (95% CI 1-2%;I (2) 0%) Conclusion and Relevance: Patients with COVID-19 present with neurological and musculoskeletal symptoms Therefore, clinicians need to be vigilant in the diagnosis and treatment of these patients",8s5s30u8
Neurological associations of COVID-19,neuro,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barr? syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2??% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin. WHERE NEXT? Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barr? syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.",u67euiat
Neurological comorbidity and severity of COVID-19,neuro,"OBJECTIVE: Neurological symptoms of COVID-19 patients have been recently described. However, no comprehensive data have been reported on pre-existing neurological comorbidities and COVID-19. This study aims at evaluating the prevalence of neurological comorbidities, and their association with COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We evaluated all consecutive patients admitted to the Emergency Room (ER) of our hospital between the 3rd March and the 14th April 2020, and diagnosed with COVID-19. Data on neurological and non-neurological diseases were extracted, as well as data on demographic characteristics and on severity degree of COVID-19. The prevalence of neurological comorbidities was calculated, and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between neurological diseases and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: We included 344 patients. Neurological comorbidities accounted for 22.4% of cases, with cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive impairment being the most frequent. Neurological comorbidity resulted independently associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 2.305; p = 0.012), as well as male gender (p = 0.001), older age (p = 0.001), neoplastic diseases (p = 0.039), and arterial hypertension (p = 0.045). When neurological comorbidity was associated with non-neurological comorbidities, the OR for severe COVID-19 rose to 7.394 (p = 0.005). Neurological patients, in particular cerebrovascular and cognitively impaired ones, received more respiratory support indication. CONCLUSION: Neurological comorbidities represent a significant determinant of COVID-19 severity, deserving a thorough evaluation since the earliest phases of infection. The vulnerability of patients affected by neurological diseases should suggest a greater attention in targeting this population for proactive viral screening.",cjb0daps
"Neurological consultations and diagnoses in a large, dedicated COVID-19 university hospital.",neuro,"BACKGROUND More than one-third of COVID-19 patients present neurological symptoms ranging from anosmia to stroke and encephalopathy. Furthermore, pre-existing neurological conditions may require special treatment and may be associated with worse outcomes. Notwithstanding, the role of neurologists in COVID-19 is probably underrecognized. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to report the reasons for requesting neurological consultations by internists and intensivists in a COVID-19-dedicated hospital. METHODS This retrospective study was carried out at Hospital das Cl?nicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S?o Paulo, Brazil, a 900-bed COVID-19 dedicated center (including 300 intensive care unit beds). COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed by SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR in nasal swabs. All inpatient neurology consultations between March 23rd and May 23rd, 2020 were analyzed. Neurologists performed the neurological exam, assessed all available data to diagnose the neurological condition, and requested additional tests deemed necessary. Difficult diagnoses were established in consensus meetings. After diagnosis, neurologists were involved in the treatment. RESULTS Neurological consultations were requested for 89 out of 1,208 (7.4%) inpatient COVID admissions during that period. Main neurological diagnoses included: encephalopathy (44.4%), stroke (16.7%), previous neurological diseases (9.0%), seizures (9.0%), neuromuscular disorders (5.6%), other acute brain lesions (3.4%), and other mild nonspecific symptoms (11.2%). CONCLUSIONS Most neurological consultations in a COVID-19-dedicated hospital were requested for severe conditions that could have an impact on the outcome. First-line doctors should be able to recognize neurological symptoms; neurologists are important members of the medical team in COVID-19 hospital care.",6q5wwo6v
Neurological manifestations and neuro??nvasive mechanisms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2,neuro,"INTRODUCTION: Infections with coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and various neurological manifestations have been reported. The aim of this study was to perform a review to describe neurological manifestations in patients with COVID??9 and possible neuro??nvasive mechanisms of Sars??oV??. METHODS: Pubmed, WebOfScience and Covid??edicated databases were searched for the combination of COVID??9 terminology and neurology terminology up to May 10(th) 2020. Social media channels were followed??p between March 15(th) and May 10(th) 2020 for postings with the same scope. Neurological manifestations were extracted from the identified manuscripts and combined to provide a useful summary for the neurologist in clinical practice. RESULTS: Neurological manifestations potentially related to COVID??9 have been reported in large studies, case series and case reports and include acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, cranial nerve manifestations and auto??mmune disorders such as Guillain??arr? Syndrome often present in patients with more severe COVID??9. Cranial nerve symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are highly prevalent in patients with mild??o??oderate COVID??9 even without associated nasal symptoms and often present in an early stage of the disease. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the neurological manifestations in patients with COVID??9, especially when rapid clinical deterioration occurs. The neurological symptoms in COVID??9 patients may be due to direct viral neurological injury or indirect neuroinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms. No antiviral treatments against the virus or vaccines for its prevention are available and the long??erm consequences of the infection on human health remain uncertain especially with regards to the neurological system.",dx1n8jap
Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19: a review and a call for action,neuro,"While the epidemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread globally, more and more evidences are collected about the presence of neurological manifestations and symptoms associated with it. A systematic review has been performed of papers published until 5 April 2020. 29 papers related to neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 were examined. The results show presence of central and peripheral nervous system manifestations related to coronavirus. Neurological manifestations, or NeuroCOVID, are part of the COVID-19 clinical picture, but questions remain regarding the frequency and severity of CNS symptoms, the mechanism of action underlying neurological symptoms, and the relationship of symptoms with the course and severity of COVID-19. Further clinical, epidemiological, and basic science research is urgently needed to understand and address neurological sequalae of COVID-19. Concomitant risk factors or determinants (e.g. demographic factors, comorbidities, or available biomarkers) that may predispose a person with COVID-19 to neurological manifestations also need to be identified. The review shows that although more and more papers are reporting neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19; however, many items remain unclear and this uncertainty calls for a global action that requires close coordination and open-data sharing between hospitals, academic institutions and the fast establishment of harmonised research priorities and research consortia to face the NeuroCOVID-19 complications.",y5l7cf31
Neuropathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection,neuro,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged as a serious jolt to human life and economy. Initial knowledge established pulmonary complications as the chief symptom, however, the neurological aspect of the disease is also becoming increasingly evident. Emerging reports of encephalopathies and similar ailments with the detection of the virus in the CSF has elicited an urgent need for investigating the possibility of neuroinvasiveness of the virus, which cannot be ruled out given the expression of low levels of ACE2 receptors in the brain. Sensory impairments of the olfactory and gustatory systems have also been reported in a large proportion of the cases, indicating the involvement of the peripheral nervous system. Hence, the possibility of neurological damage caused by the virus demands immediate attention and investigation of the mechanisms involved, so as to customize the treatment of patients presenting with neurological complications.",ca9oxl7f
Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations associated with severe coronavirus infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis with comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic,neuro,"BACKGROUND: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. FINDINGS: 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12?2 years (SD 4?1) to 68?0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27?9%; 95% CI 20?5-36?0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32?6%; 24?7-40?9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35?7%; 27?6-44?2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34?1%; 26?2-42?5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41?9%; 22?5-50?5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0?7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10?5%; 95% CI 7?5-14?1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12?1%; 8?6-16?3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12?3%; 7?7-17?7] of 171), irritability (28 [12?8%; 8?7-17?6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18?9%; 14?1-24?2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19?3%; 15?1-23?9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30?4%; 23?9-37?3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100?0%; 88?0-100?0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32?2% (95% CI 23?7-42?0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14?9% (12?1-18?2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14?8% (11?1-19?4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76?9%; 95% CI 68?1-84?6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35?3 months (SD 40?1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. INTERPRETATION: If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nervous system: A review of the literature on neurological involvement in novel coronavirus disease-(COVID-19),neuro,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is believed to have emerged from an animal source and has been spreading rapidly among humans. Recent evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits neurotropic properties and causes neurological diseases. Here, we review the literature on neurological involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infections and the possible mechanisms of invasion of the nervous system by this virus, to provide a summary and critical analysis of the early reporting of neurological involvement in COVID-19. An exhaustive search of scientific articles on neurological involvement in COVID-19 was performed in the Web of Science, Scopus, Medline/PubMed, and several other databases. Nineteen relevant articles that had been published or were in preprint were carefully selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on our research, we found that patients with COVID-19 can present with neurological symptoms that can be broadly divided into central nervous system involvement, such as headache, dizziness, altered mental state, and disorientation, and peripheral nervous system involvement, such as anosmia and hypogeusia. Most of these patients are in the older age group and exhibit comorbidities, especially hypertension, and severe infection. In extreme presentations of COVID-19, some patients exhibit seizures, stroke, flaccid paraparesis, corticospinal weakness, and even coma. Moreover, the neurological manifestations can occur independently of the respiratory system. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause multiple neurological syndromes in a more complex presentation. Therefore, this review elucidated the involvement of the nervous system in SARS-CoV-2 infection and will hopefully help improve the management of COVID-19.",3n163duj
The S1P??1PR Axis in Neurological Disorders??nsights into Current and Future Therapeutic Perspectives,neuro,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), derived from membrane sphingolipids, is a pleiotropic bioactive lipid mediator capable of evoking complex immune phenomena. Studies have highlighted its importance regarding intracellular signaling cascades as well as membrane-bound S1P receptor (S1PR) engagement in various clinical conditions. In neurological disorders, the S1P??1PR axis is acknowledged in neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory, and cerebrovascular disorders. Modulators of S1P signaling have enabled an immense insight into fundamental pathological pathways, which were pivotal in identifying and improving the treatment of human diseases. However, its intricate molecular signaling pathways initiated upon receptor ligation are still poorly elucidated. In this review, the authors highlight the current evidence for S1P signaling in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders as well as stroke and present an array of drugs targeting the S1P signaling pathway, which are being tested in clinical trials. Further insights on how the S1P??1PR axis orchestrates disease initiation, progression, and recovery may hold a remarkable potential regarding therapeutic options in these neurological disorders.",mshku2nf
Update on neurological manifestations of COVID-19,neuro,"Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2) has a high homology with other cousin of coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS).

The main complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is respiratory failure, but several patients have also been admitted to the hospital with neurological symptoms. Direct invasion, hematogenic rout, retrograde and anterograde transport along peripheral nerves are considered as main neuroinvasion mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we describe the possible routes for entering of SARS-CoV-2 into the nervous system. Then, the neurological manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) are reviewed. Furthermore, the neuropathology of the virus and its impacts on other neurological disorders are discussed.",l5z7yq86
"COVID-19, smoking, vaping and quitting: A representative population survey in England",smoking,"Aims: To explore 1) associations between suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, hand washing, smoking status, e-cigarette use, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use and 2) whether COVID-19 has prompted smoking and vaping quit attempts, and more smoking inside the home. Design: Cross-sectional household surveys of a representative sample of the population in England from April-May 2020. Participants: The sample included 3,285 adults aged [??18 years. Measurements: Participants who reported they definitely or think they had coronavirus were classified as having a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home, before eating, before preparing foods or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had i) attempted to quit smoking, ii) attempted to quit vaping, and iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home. Findings: Odds of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were significantly greater among current smokers (20.9%, adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.04-1.73) and long-term (>1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, ORadj=1.33, 95%CI=1.05-1.68) than never smokers (14.5%). Recent (<1-year) ex-smokers had non-significantly greater odds of suspected infection (22.2%, ORadj=1.50, 95%CI=0.85-2.53, Bayes factor=0.55-1.17). Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection by NRT use and medium differences by e-cigarette use. With the exception of hand washing before face touching, engagement in hand washing behaviours was high (>85%) regardless of nicotine use. A minority (12.2%) of past-year smokers who made a quit attempt in the past three months were triggered by COVID-19, and approximately one-in-ten current e-cigarette users reported attempting to quit vaping because of COVID-19. Most people reported smoking the same amount inside the home. Conclusions: In a representative sample of the adult population in England, current smokers and long-term ex-smokers had higher odds of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection than never smokers, but there were no large differences by NRT or e-cigarette use. In general, engagement in hand washing was high regardless of nicotine or tobacco use. A minority of past-year smokers and current e-cigarette users, respectively, attempted to quit smoking/vaping due to COVID-19.",r6iqiy1n
Current Smoking is Not Associated with COVID-19,smoking,"Despite the main complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection regard lung involvement, the prevalence of current smoking in COVID-19 patients is very low even if one might have anticipated that opposite.

"Current smoking, former smoking, and adverse outcome among hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis",smoking,"Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and effects of current smoking on adverse outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) identified 18 (from a total of 1398) relevant studies. Pooled current smoking prevalence was compared with the gender-adjusted and gender and age-adjusted, population-based expected prevalence by calculating prevalence odds ratio (POR). The association between current, compared with non-current and former, smoking and adverse outcome was examined. A secondary analysis was performed by including 12 pre-publications (30 studies in total). All analyses were performed using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Among 6515 patients, the pooled prevalence of current smoking was 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.8??.1%]. The gender-adjusted POR was 0.20 (95% CI: 0.16??.25, p &lt; 0.001), and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.19??.30, p &lt; 0.001). Current smokers were more likely to have an adverse outcome compared with non-current smokers [odds ratio (OR): 1.53, 95%CI: 1.06??.20, p = 0.022] but less likely compared with former smokers (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.27??.74, p = 0.003). When pre-publications were added (n = 10,631), the gender-adjusted POR was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.19??.38, p &lt; 0.001) and the gender and age-adjusted POR was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24??.48, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This meta-analysis of retrospective observational case series found an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Hospitalized current smokers had higher odds compared with non-current smokers but lower odds compared with former smokers for an adverse outcome. Smoking cannot be considered a protective measure for COVID-19. However, the hypothesis that nicotine may have a protective effect in COVID-19 that is partially masked by smoking-related toxicity and by the abrupt cessation of nicotine intake when smokers are hospitalized should be explored in laboratory studies and clinical trials using pharmaceutical nicotine products.",imgg5ugf
"Prevalence, Severity and Mortality associated with COPD and Smoking in patients with COVID-19: A Rapid Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",smoking,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an evolving infectious disease that dramatically spread all over the world in the early part of 2020. No studies have yet summarised the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We synthesised a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 6.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%. Conclusion: Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.",plfjkp5f
Smoking Prevalence is Low in Symptomatic Patients Admitted for COVID-19.,smoking,"There is currently little information regarding the role of active smoking in predisposing to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This retrospective case series includes 441 patients with confirmed Covid-19, who were consecutively admitted between March 5 and March 31, 2020, at a tertiary referral center in Parma, Northern Italy, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. 273 (62%) patients were males. Median age was 71 y/o, 156 patients (35%) died during hospitalization and 285 (65%) were discharged because clinically healed. 21 patients (5%) were active smokers and 44 (10%) were ex-smokers, while 376 (85%) were non-smokers. Male sex, history of prior cardiovascular disease, D-dimer and C-reactive protein were significantly more prevalent or higher in the subgroup of 156 patients who died during hospital stay, compared with 285 patients discharged alive. Active smokers were only 21, this number corresponding to less than 5% prevalence of active smokers, which is disproportionately low compared with the 24% prevalence of smokers in the general Italian population (p<0.001). The very low prevalence of smokers in our COVID-19 cohort seemingly replicates the findings that can be extracted from descriptive tables in Chinese reports and also in the recent US reports from New York City. The current study is useful since it suggests that smokers may carry some type of protective mechanism from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, although this should definitely be confirmed in specifically-designed, controlled studies.",fwq5we2k
Smoking and the risk of COVID-19 in a large observational population study,smoking,"BACKGROUND Smokers are generally more susceptible to infectious respiratory diseases and are at higher risk of developing severe complications from these infections. Conflicting reports exist regarding the impact of smoking on the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS We carried out a population-based study among over 3,000,000 adult members of Clalit Health Services, the largest health provider in Israel. Since the beginning of the disease outbreak, 114,545 individuals underwent RT-PCR testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and 4.0% had positive results. We performed a case-control study among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, to assess the impact of smoking on infection incidence and severity. Individuals with positive tests were matched in a 1:5 ratio to individuals tested negative, of the same sex, age, and ethnicity/religion. Conditional logistic regressions were performed to evaluate odds ratios for current and previous smoking on the risk of testing positive. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among patients infected with COVID-19 to estimate the association between smoking and fatal or severe disease requiring ventilation. Regressions were performed with and without adjustment for preexisting medical conditions. RESULTS In the matched cohort, current smokers (9.8%) were significantly less prevalent among members tested positive compared to the general population, and to matched members tested negative (19.4%, P<0.001). Current smoking was associated with significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) for testing positive OR=0.457 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.407-0.514). Among patients tested positive, there was no evidence of significantly increased risk of developing severe or fatal disease. CONCLUSION The risk of infection by COVID-19 appears to be reduced by half among current smokers. This intriguing finding may reveal unique infection mechanisms present for COVID-19 which may be targeted to combat the disease and reduce its infection rate.",lbxg93hl
Smoking increases the risk of infectious diseases: A narrative review,smoking,"Smoking is relevant to infectious diseases resulting in increased prevalence and mortality. In this article, we aim to provide an overview of the effects of smoking in various infections and to explain the potential mechanisms. We searched PubMed and other relevant databases for scientific studies that explored the relationship between smoking and infection. The mechanisms of susceptibility to infection in smokers may include alteration of the structural, functional and immunologic host defences. Smoking is one of the main risk factors for infections in the respiratory tract, digestive tract, reproductive tract, and other systems in humans, increasing the prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, SARS-CoV, and the current SARS-CoV-2. Smoking cessation can reduce the risk of infection. Smoking increases the incidence of infections and aggravates the progress and prognosis of infectious diseases in a dose-dependent manner. Smoking cessation promotion and education are the most practical and economical preventive measures to reduce aggravation of disease infection owing to tobacco use.",v0bd9ls0
Smoking is Associated with COVID-19 Progression: A Meta-Analysis,smoking,"Objective: To determine the association between smoking and progression of COVID-19. Design: A meta-analysis of 12 published papers. Data Source: PubMed database was searched on April 6, 2020. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: We included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease. Search terms included smoking, smoker*, characteristics, risk factors, outcomes, and COVID-19, COVID, coronavirus, sar cov-2, sar cov 2. There were no language limitations. One author extracted information for each study, screened the abstract or the full text, with questions resolved through discussion among both authors. A random effects meta-analysis was applied. Main Outcome Measures: The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease. Results: We identified 12 papers with a total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients, 878 (9.7%) with severe disease and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39, p=0.001). Limitations in the 12 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher. Conclusions: Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers. Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.",ws0s2qk1
Systematic review of the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China: could nicotine be a therapeutic option?,smoking,"The effects of smoking on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0-3.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6-14.6%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9-8.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI 5.7-8.9%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.",3518392r
The double-edged relationship between COVID-19 stress and smoking: Implications for smoking cessation,smoking,"INTRODUCTION: Although recent research shows that smokers respond differently to the COVID-19 pandemic, it offers little explanation of why some have increased their smoking, while others decreased it In this study, we examined a possible explanation for these different responses: pandemic-related stress METHODS: We conducted an online survey among a representative sample of Dutch current smokers from 11-18 May 2020 (n=957) During that period, COVID-19 was six weeks past the (initial) peak of cases and deaths in the Netherlands Included in the survey were measures of how the COVID-19 pandemic had changed their smoking, if at all (no change, increased smoking, decreased smoking), and a measure of stress due to COVID-19 RESULTS: Overall, while 14 1% of smokers reported smoking less due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 18 9% of smokers reported smoking more A multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that there was a dose-response effect of stress: smokers who were somewhat stressed were more likely to have either increased (OR=2 37;95% CI: 1 49-3 78) or reduced (OR=1 80;95% CI: 1 07-3 05) their smoking Severely stressed smokers were even more likely to have either increased (OR=3 75;95% CI: 1 84-7 64) or reduced (OR=3 97;95% CI: 1 70-9 28) their smoking Thus, stress was associated with both increased and reduced smoking, independently from perceived difficulty of quitting and level of motivation to quit CONCLUSIONS: Stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic appears to affect smokers in different ways, some smokers increase their smoking while others decrease it While boredom and restrictions in movement might have stimulated smoking, the threat of contracting COVID-19 and becoming severely ill might have motivated others to improve their health by quitting smoking These data highlight the importance of providing greater resources for cessation services and the importance of creating public campaigns to enhance cessation in this dramatic time",3ziuc7os
"Underlying respiratory diseases, specifically COPD, and smoking are associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis",smoking,"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly reaching over 3 million of confirmed cases worldwide. The association of respiratory diseases and smoking, both highly prevalent globally, with COVID-19 severity has not been elucidated. Given the gap in the evidence and the growing prevalence of COVID-19, the objective of this study was to explore the association of underlying respiratory diseases and smoking with severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A systematic search was performed to identify studies reporting prevalence of respiratory diseases and/or smoking in relation with disease severity in patients with confirm COVID-19, published between January 1 to April 15, 2020 in English language. Pooled odds-ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. FINDINGS: Twenty two studies met the inclusion criteria. All the studies presented data of 13,184 COVID-19 patients (55% males). Patients with severe outcomes were older and a larger percentage were males compared with the non-severe. Pooled analysis showed that prevalence of respiratory diseases (OR 4.21; 95% CI, 2.9-6.0) and smoking (current smoking OR 1.98; 95% CI, 1.16-3.39 and former smoking OR 3.46; 95% CI, 2.46-4.85) were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Results suggested that underlying respiratory diseases, specifically COPD, and smoking were associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings may support the planning of preventive interventions and could contribute to improvements in the assessment and management of patient risk factors in clinical practice, leading to the mitigation of severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection.",6sezttoj
